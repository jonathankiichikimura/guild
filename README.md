# Guild — Pitch Website

**Simplicity. Affordability. Humanity.**

This repository contains a static, Bootstrap-based website created as a visual companion to the *Guild* demo pitch.

The site mirrors the pitch deck content and includes an additional Core Features page that expands on ideas not covered within the slide time limit.

## Purpose

## Project Concept Summary

Guild is a concept for a web app that reframes everyday help as a quest-based marketplace.

Users post simple help requests as “quests,” while others browse, accept, and complete them—prioritizing simplicity, affordability, and human connection.

---

## Core Features (Conceptual)

- Quest creation for everyday help requests
- Quest board for browsing available tasks
- Two user roles: requester and helper
- Simple quest lifecycle (open → accepted → completed)
- RPG-inspired terminology for approachability

> Note: Safety systems, payments, and moderation are intentionally out of scope for this pitch website.
